# Why does this work?
#
# - We curl the simorgh-infrastructure Jenkins job and look explicitly for the `result` to equal `SUCCESS` with some super dumb regex
# - The `result` of a currently building job is set to `null`, which will also equal a failure
# - We run the job twice to mitigate the tiny chance of a race condition between the simorgh-infrastructure job being triggered
#   and the /lastBuild/api/json being updated (3 seconds at worst)
